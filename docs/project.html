							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic10.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The HAATS project is based off the names of all of the members involved: Heeba, Ally, Annie, Tiffany, and Sarah. We completed this project in our Senior year of high school in 2021. This project involved obtaining materials including paint, acrylic sheets for the doors, and plywood, designing and constructing the library, and then contacting the city Parks and Recreation department to get permission to install the library in a local park.</p>
							<p>The portions of this project that I was in charge of were designing the library, determining what materials and what quantities of those materials we needed, and leading the actual construction of the library. We were able to get the materials and books as donations and therefore this project was fully funded by donations. The library is still in the local park to this day and we restock the books on occasion.</p>
