						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>I am a computer science student and work part-time. I enjoy spending time with my 
							pets, family, and friends when I'm not working on school work or one of my hobbies.</p>
						<div class="features">
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-school"></span>
								<h3>University</h3>
								<p>I am a current computer science major at the University of Texas at Dallas 
									with a graduation date in May 2025. My favorite classes so far have been my 
									programming classes and my math classes, including calculus and linear algebra.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-briefcase"></span>
								<h3>Work</h3>
								<p>I work with Total College Prep as a tutor for AP subjects including AP Calculus, 
									AP Statistics, and AP Human Geography. I also assist with SAT and ACT preparation 
									classes for groups of up to 8 students. I really enjoy teaching students and 
									helping them to grow more confident in their skills! </p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-gamepad"></span>
								<h3>Games</h3>
								<p>I love video games and spend a lot of time playing games, reading news 
									about games, or watching other people play through games. I mostly play 
									strategy and RPG games, but I keep up with popular releases and will pick
									 up the occasional interesting indie game. Indie games are a huge passion 
									 of mine because they are often a labor of love and take more creative risks 
									 than the average AAA release. </p>
								</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-puzzle-piece"></span>
								<h3>Hobbies</h3>
								<p>Outside of school, work, and gaming, some of my other interests are 
									baking, knitting, and jigsaw puzzles. All of these are hobbies that 
									require meticulous attention to detail to avoid mistakes in the final 
									product, but I enjoy the challenge involved in keeping my focus on a 
									methodical process! </p>

										has the option of 2 human players alternating turns, 1 human player 
										and 1 computer player, or 2 computer players that randomly chose squares. </p>
